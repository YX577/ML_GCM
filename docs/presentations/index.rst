Poster and oral presentations of the ML_GCM
===========================================

I've made a science poster presentation of this project (A0 poster, portrait format). If you are reading this you can see the much better presentation on :doc:`this web page <../index>`, so you don't need the poster, but I'm keeping it here so I can find it again if needed.

I also have a slide deck for an oral presentation - kept here for the same reason. (Same slide deck in two different formats).
