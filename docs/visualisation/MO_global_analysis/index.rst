This video shows one year of the weather, as reconstructed by the Met Office global deterministic analysis. The data shown in this video are distributed through the `Met Office Data Portal <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/met-office-data-for-reuse/discovery>`_ *but* only a few days data is online at any one time. So you will not be able to retrieve all the data needed to reproduce this video unless you have access to the Met Office MASS archive (you could use `ERA5 <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5>`_ data instead).
