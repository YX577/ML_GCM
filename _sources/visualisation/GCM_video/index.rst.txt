The :doc:`GCM ML model <../../models/GCM/index>` produces fields of near surface temperature, sea-level pressure, and wind, at 6-hourly intervals (as well as the associated latent-space states. So we can make a video analagous to the :doc:`compressed 20CRv2c version <../20CRv2c_latent_space/index>` but using the ML GCM output.

   Run the ML GCM <../../models/GCM/index>
   Plot a single frame <plot>
   Plot all the frames and make a video <video>
