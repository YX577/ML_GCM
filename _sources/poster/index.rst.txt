Poster presentation of the ML_GCM
=================================

I've made a science poster presentation of this project (A0 poster, portrait format). If you are reading this you can see the much better presentation on :doc:`this web page <../index>`, so you don't need the poster, but I'm keeping it here so I can find it again if needed.
